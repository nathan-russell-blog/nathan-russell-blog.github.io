#Welcome to my programming blog. 

Hey guy, what's with the name? 
-----
*"What's a layman programmer?"* you ask? Well, that's me - or at least what I feel is a suitable description 
of myself. I know, [humble brag](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=humblebrag). *"Care to elaborate on that?"* 
Sure. I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2012 with a BA in 
[Actuarial Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science).

If you're familiar with Actuarial Science, that's great - you would have saved me a slightly tedious, several minute long 
explanation in a face-to-face conversation. If not, don't worry, you're not alone. Just throwing out a rough estimate, 
I'd say that *maybe* 1 in 3 people know what an actuary actually does (pardon the alliteration...) - and by **know** 
I mean something besides *"Oh, like the guy in that [Ben Stiller movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Along_Came_Polly), right??"*. 
Anyways, a perfect 
segue to my next humble brag, right? I'll resist the urge just this once, and direct you to the Wiki page linked above for more 
details.
