#Welcome to my programming blog. 

Hey guy, what's with the name?

*"What's a layman programmer?"* you ask? Well, that's me - or at least what I feel is a suitable description 
of myself. I know, [humble brag](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=humblebrag). *"Care to elaborate on that?"* 
Sure. I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2012 with a BA in 
[Actuarial Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science).

Yes, Actuarial Science, not *Computer Science*. My exposure to programming during this time was very limited - 
in my final semester I took an actuarial statistics course which made heavy use of the 
[R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). IMO this is *the* way to teach statistics courses, 
primarily because in the *real world* you will spend approximately zero seconds crunching numbers with 
a pencil and paper.
