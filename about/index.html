<h2>Hey guy, what&rsquo;s with the name? </h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a layman programmer?&rdquo;</em> you ask? Well, that&rsquo;s me - or at least what I feel is a suitable description
of myself. I know, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=humblebrag">humble brag</a>. <em>&ldquo;Care to elaborate on that?&rdquo;</em>
Sure. I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2012 with a BA in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science">Actuarial Science</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/aboutpage/uconn-sunset.jpg"></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with Actuarial Science, that&rsquo;s great - you would have saved me a slightly tedious, several minute long
explanation in a face-to-face conversation. If not, don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re not alone. Just throwing out a rough estimate,
I&rsquo;d say that <em>maybe</em> 1 in 3 people know what an actuary actually does (pardon the alliteration&hellip;) - and by <strong>know</strong>
I mean something besides <em>&ldquo;Oh, like the guy in that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Along_Came_Polly">Ben Stiller movie</a>, right??&rdquo;</em>.
Anyways, a perfect
segue to my next humble brag, right? I&rsquo;ll resist the urge just this once, and direct you to the Wiki page linked above for more
details.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;So getting back to <del>your imaginary</del> my question&hellip;&rdquo;</em> Right, sorry. Getting back to the point, my academic background is in
mathematics, not computer science. In fact, up until my final semester of college I didn&rsquo;t know a lick of programming,
as my only prior encounter with code was Introductory Visual Basic in 9th grade. Of course, the little bit I might
have learned in that class had long since faded - my sole takeaway being that some instructors take variable naming
conventions <del>very seriously</del> way too seriously for a freshman highschool classroom. But in the Spring semester of my senior year
I took a <a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/courses/course-info/?Course=3621&amp;Campus=STORR&amp;Year=2012&amp;Semester=Spring">great course</a>
on Actuarial Statistics to fulfill a <a href="http://www.beanactuary.org/study/?fa=vee-requirements">VEE</a> requirement - and was
fortunate to have a <a href="https://hartman.byu.edu/">fantastic professor</a> whose curriculum involved a lot of hands-on work with
the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R programming language</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/aboutpage/rabbit.jpg"></p>

<p>I certainly was not an R guru in any sense of the word by the end of that semester (or even by now, for that matter), but it was a
valuable experience nonetheless, leading me down a rabbit hole into the vast universe of programming. Putting things more concretely, I
write this passage in plain text using my editor of choice, Vim, on a laptop that dual boots two flavors of Linux, CentOS and Ubuntu -
from a SSD that I swapped the factory hard disk for - which by some sort of magic (re: the much appreciated time, effort, and
ingenuity invested by numerous individuals who felt compelled to give back to the open-source community) will be transformed into
the colored, stylized, formatted, static webpage you now see, simply by issuing a quick <code>rake generate</code> and <code>rake deploy</code>.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;You seem to just be patting yourself on the back. Is there a point to all this?&rdquo;</em> Yes and yes. The point is this: three years ago,
I hadn&rsquo;t heard of any of those things. I had no concept of GitHub, Sublime Text, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>,
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29">hashbangs</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified">yum</a>?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool">apt-get</a>? <em>What the hell is that?</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus who?</a>
<a href="http://www.aristeia.com/">Scott Meyers?</a> <em>Nope, never heard of them.</em> Now these<code>${tools,software,people}</code> are part of everyday
life (well, not so much the latter, but you get what I&rsquo;m saying&hellip;). I didn&rsquo;t learn any SQL, C++, or Bash in a classroom. Instrumental as
it was, 99% of the R code I write during my nine-to-five wasn&rsquo;t acquired in my actuarial stats course. That&rsquo;s not a complaint, mind you -
being a math major wasn&rsquo;t a walk in the park, but I loved it then, and still do. Yet on any given day, I spend <strong>much</strong> more time programming
than solving equations. In reality, most of the tangible skills that I get paid for have been picked up from blogs, books purchased from
Amazon, StackOverflow, or this one guy I work with who seems to know <del>a little</del> a lot about everything. As someone who had never even heard
the term &ldquo;regex&rdquo; not <em>that</em> long ago, having a coworker with a strong Perl background is truly a blessing, trust me. Occasionally I reflect
on this, and wonder how it&rsquo;s possible for perspectives, goals, daily routines, interests, etc.. to change so dramatically in a few years. Then I
remember that the internet is <del>big</del>
<a href="http://www.websitemagazine.com/content/blogs/posts/archive/2014/07/22/do-you-know-how-big-the-internet-really-is-infographic.aspx">fucking huge</a>.
There&rsquo;s a lot of knowledge floating around out there - and it&rsquo;s basically free. And in the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Age of Information</a>,
I&rsquo;d be crazy to <em>not</em> learn a few lines of code, right? Right.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/aboutpage/wrap-it-up-box.png"></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Sooo&hellip;&rdquo;</em> So, wrapping it up, this blog is mainly about things I&rsquo;ve picked up from my day-to-day programming experiences, things I actually use on
the job (hint: I don&rsquo;t work for Google, or Apple, or anywhere crazy like that). But as always, if you see something incorrect, or think you have a
better approach, feel free to contribute.</p>
